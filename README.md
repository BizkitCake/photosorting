# photosorting

Disclaimer: I'm not a programmer of any kind. The goal of this project is to create a photosorting python script using ChatGPT.

## How to use?

1. Clone it to your host
2. Install `ffmpeg` via Brew:
    ```
    >>> brew install ffmpeg
    ```
3. Create a new virtual environment and activate it:
    ```
    >>> virtualenv photoSort
    >>> source photoSort/bin/activate
    ```
4. To run the script over sample media files, launch it and press Enter without typing anything:
    ```
    >>> python3 sorting.py
    ```
5. If your folder name is different, you can pass it as an input string. The path is relative only at the moment.
